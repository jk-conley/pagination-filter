# Pagination Filter

This was the second project in Javascript at treehouse. I was tasked with building a pagination filter that placed up to 10 items on each page. I learned about unobtrusive js, array methods, jquery, and the DOM. It was a fun and challenging project. What challeneged me the most was figuring out how to get a specific set of items in the array to show up only on their specified page. The next challenge for me was in the exceeds expectations section adding a search feature. Again, like in my first project, breaking these up into smaller parts helped tremendously in developing the logic and code.
